# ClearGoose

lag was never an option

## About

In-development plugin to serve as a replacement for
<a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/">
ClearLag</a>, specifically the plugin's item clear functionality. While it works as simply as possible, complaints arise
from both players and admins.

<b>Player Complaints:</b>

- Mining an item right before the clearlag will delete it
  (can be problematic for complex items like giving another person a sword or written book)
- Players who recently die near the approach of the item clear will lose all there stuff

<b>Admin Complaint</b>

- When giving players their items back, admins have no idea whether what they are telling the truth or not leading to
  people abusing the item clear for items they did not have/lose
